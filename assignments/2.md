#### Instructions
1. Total marks: 6
2. Use TFP with Jax substrate for distributions
3. Use Jax for autograd functionality and vector programming
4. The assignment has to be done in groups of two
5. The assignment should be a single Jupyter notebook.

#### Dataset

Create the following datasets to be used in the following questions

1. Dataset 1

```python
import jax.numpy as jnp
import jax
x = jnp.linspace(-2, 2, 100)
f = 3*x + 2.0
eps = 0.5*jax.random.normal(key=jax.random.PRNGKey(0), shape=(100, ))
y = f + eps
```

2. Dataset 2

```python
import jax.numpy as jnp
import jax
x = jnp.linspace(-2, 2, 100)
f = 3*x + 2.0
eps = 0.5*jax.random.normal(key=jax.random.PRNGKey(0), shape=(100, ))
y = f + eps
y = y.at[1].set(y[1] + 3)
y = y.at[30].set(y[30] + 1)
```

3. Dataset 3

```python
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
import numpy as np
X, y = make_classification(
    n_features=2, n_redundant=0, n_informative=2, random_state=1, n_clusters_per_class=1
)
rng = np.random.RandomState(2)
X += 2 * rng.uniform(size=X.shape)
```

#### Questions

1. Assume `sigma=1 ` for the likelihood noise, learn the MLE parameters for Dataset 1 assuming Normal likelihood. [0.5 marks] 
2. Assume `sigma=1 ` for the likelihood noise, learn the MLE parameters for Dataset 2 assuming Normal likelihood. [0.5 marks] 
3. Learn the MLE parameters for Dataset 1 assuming Normal likelihood. Do not assume `sigma` and also estimate it using MLE. You may prefer to learn `log(sigma)` as a part of your optimisation procedure. Plot predicted function along with one sigma band to show likelihood noise. [0.5 marks] 
4. Repeat question 3 for Dataset 2. [0.5 marks]
5. Assume `sigma=1 ` for the likelihood noise, learn the MAP parameters for Dataset 1 assuming Normal likelihood and a Normal prior: P(theta) = N(0, b^2 I). Show the effect of varying `b` on the MAP parameters and the learnt function. [1 marks]
6. Repeat question 6, but instead of Normal prior choose a Laplace prior [0.5 marks]
6. Repeat question 3 for Dataset 2 but instead of Normal likelihood, Student-T likelihood with varying degrees of freedom. [1 mark]
7. Implement Logistic regression using Bernoulli likelihood and learn the MLE and MAP parameters for Dataset 3. For MAP, assume normal prior. Also, plot the decision surface and the variance plot.[1.5 marks]
